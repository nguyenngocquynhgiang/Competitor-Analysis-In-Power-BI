# Case Study: Competitor Sales Analysis in Power BI

This Power BI case study follows a real-world business use case where I will apply the concepts of ETL and visualization. Through Power BI and Power Query Editor, I will work on the development of a complete Power BI report starting from data integration from multiple sources, data transformation, modeling, and then visualization.

I will carry out a sales and market share analysis, focusing not only on the company's performance internally, reflecting on how well the products sell, but also externally analyzing how well they are doing against competing manufacturers. Thus, business users can make informed decisions and take actions based on their data.

By the end of this case study, I will have a stronger understanding of competitor sales analysis and gain more confidence in using Power BI on my own datasets.

## 1. Preparing Data and Model

In the first phase, I will start by exploring and integrating the dataset into Power BI and understanding the challenges faced with uncleaned data. Then, using Power Query Editor operations, I will clean and mash up the data to make it usable for reporting.

## 2. Discovering Sales Trends

Next, after loading the cleaned data into Power BI, I will continue building a common data model, analyzing the manufacturer's product growth, and comparing my manufacturer against competitors across multiple geographies.

## 3. Creating a Data-Driven Story

In this final phase, I will enhance my Power BI report by making it more dynamic and interactive using images and adding navigations. I will also leverage advanced features and visuals to present the data in a compelling story format, allowing end users to make informed decisions.
